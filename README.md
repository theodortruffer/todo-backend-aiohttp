Todo Backend
-----
This is a todo backend build with python aiohttp and mongodb. 

### Requirements

- docker engine (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Getting Started

Change working dir to this directory and start the docker containers with the following command:

```docker-container up```

The backend will now run on port 8080. To change the port, edit the docker-compose.yml file.
